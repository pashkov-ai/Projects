# Unleash the Geek

Result: 490/2162

Both players control a team of several robots. The teams start out at the same points on the map, at the headquarters. The robots can use radars from the headquarters to detect and mine Amadeusium veins. They may also trap certain areas of the map with EMP traps. These can be triggered by robots which are then rendered inoperable.
